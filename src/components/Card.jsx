/* Other notes below on Image relative path issue fixing */

// Example --> <img src= { new URL("../images/asdf.png", import.meta.url)} className="randomImage"/>

// Try npm run build to make a distribution dist folder if you happen need it for other troubleshooting. We don't really want to commit these to github, however.

/* Another note: If I have trouble with vite incorrectly reading my images from the relative path not pointing to the correct parent file:

Go into vite.config.js file:
go into the export define config function

Potential workaround: --> Adding base: "./", into vite.config.js file 
// Whenever we open a project it is going to by default base it on the root directory of url, but one level up above the file we work on (to address intense levels of nesting) in current directory rather than random file in assets or src
// --> However, that won't be needed in my case, I've got multiple folders being nested so I will not be changing the vite.config.js file necessarily to cater for "./", and it seems that leaving the configurations as is will do.

// Should we aim to fix things up in base, we would theoretically run npm run build again to update the distributable folder.
